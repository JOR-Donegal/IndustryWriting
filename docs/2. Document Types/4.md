# Physical diagrams
For several reasons, it can be very useful to know what equipment physically looks like, where it fits in the cabinet, how it is wired up, etc. Diagrams of this type of physical diagrams.

The type of physical diagram I brief from year to year may be a bit different, but these diagrams are there to provide a consistent role.

With a physical network diagram, I want to see how devices are interconnected so that I can assemble the network correctly. If I lose communications between two switches, I need to know which interfaces to check. If I'm wiring up a server, which port goes to which switch/port. When you work in GNS3 you are creating a simple physical diagram. If you add in device identifiers, port numbers, media type, and some clarifying notes, you properly meet the requirement for a physical network diagram.

A modern data center server could have seven or more physical connections. What does each connection do? What color cable should I use? Which media type? What VLAN and port should that connection go into?

How I arrange equipment in the cabinet is critical, both functionally and for safety.

These are the kinds of things that I want to address with a physical diagram.

For my assignments, use any simple drawing tool, PowerPoint is fine. As part of your license entitlement in the University, you may download a full copy of Microsoft Visio. This is one of the standard packages used throughout the industry. For my assignments, you don’t need to use Visio. I recommend you download and install it when you finish the taught modules. Find a basic online course which covers an introduction and the terminology and locate templates for the kinds of devices you are interested in. You will find this of use if you ever do this work in industry.

## Physical Network Diagram
A physical diagram of the network will show equipment, interfaces, and interconnections

A physical network diagram has a specific purpose, it is intended to provide enough information for someone to build the physical network or diagnose inter-connectivity problems.

This diagram will show all the physical devices, and how they are interconnected, which ports have been used and what media types are used to connect devices.

You could show L1, wiring & fiber, media type.

- I would expect access layer connections to be CAT6 and inter-switch connections to be MMF, OM4 or 5 There are no justifications on a site this size for SMF or for mixing media and transceivers, etc. 
- There must be enough information to allow local fault-finding. 
- Physical network devices 
- Key servers (DNS, DHCP, NTP, AAA) 
- Interfaces, make sure you show all port IDs 
- Management IP addresses 
- Interconnections with media types

You can add notes if it helps to make the diagram more comprehensible. It is not essential, but it would be useful to color code VLAN/Trunk connections.

It is a diagram, so it must be clear and obvious. If I made a comment about presentation, then the diagram could do with some visual improvements.

I would never show individual PCs, except as a total count.

If there is a hierarchy, this is where I would describe it.

## Server Diagrams
A physical server diagram will show server equipment, interfaces, and interconnections. A logical diagram will show which VLANs it connects to, IP addresses, gateways, etc.

It can be very useful to provide a block diagram of each server with the major components detailed. Alternatively, a VISIO template can be a useful base.

On a physical diagram, show a representation and include notes explaining:

- Network connections, purpose, media type and description. Most servers come with 2 x 1Gb/s integrated on the mother board. What will these be used for? 
- You will probably add a card with 2 or 4 x 10Gb/s. What will these be used for? 
- Show the media and connector type, otherwise the patch cables may be incorrect. 
- Any other external connections, BMC for example? 
- Dual PSUs if present, to separate power rails. 
- Disk slots and types, RAID arrays or storage organization details. 
- Memory and processor(s), at install, show eventual capacity. 

For redundancy, you may be connecting to multiple switches, if so, you need to clearly show this.

On a logical diagram, show:

- The management address and interface 
- The interfaces and VLANs to which it connects to and their characteristics.
- You may combine diagrams and annotations always help.

## Cabinet Physical Diagrams
A physical diagram of the cabinet will show server, ancillary equipment, physical interfaces, and interconnections.

Correct cabinet layout will show some thought for weight and access requirements. You could show the U height each device is installed at. Add some notes to clarify details (for example, associating PDUs with UPS, etc).

The easiest way to do this is perhaps in Excel. Visio is also OK, but you need to put in a lot of detail to get as much semantic content as the spreadsheet below.

You could identify
 
- IP ratings. 
- How does airflow/cooling work? 
- UPS/STS at the bottom. 
- PDUs in banks of two for redundancy, clearly annotated or associated with a UPS or dirty power. 
- Horizontal cable management in appropriate places. 
- Heavy equipment low down, SAN/NAS, etc. 
- Servers stacked in groups of whatever the cluster size is (maybe not relevant for all assignments) 
- KVM switch, keyboard mounted c. 900mm above floor level, annotated. 
- Network equipment at top of rack. 

If you are terminating fibre/copper etc., where is that located?

You might show front and back, back may only show 0U PDUs, but sometimes we use rear-mount switches.

In some cases, I ask for a remote site cabinet layout, the calculations are probably easy. In other cases, I specify a small data centre layout, this may be more complex and will almost certainly be accompanied by a calculation spreadsheet.

To specify the cabinet layout, you need to know if the UPS is in the rack or central. Then you need to decide equipment type and layout and define a pod size. For a 5-server cluster with 2*ToR switches and 2*SAN, probably c. 20U. You could have two pods per 47U cabinet. 

In assignments which require a cabinet document, the most important component is the calculation sheet and notes explaining your rationale, everything else is predicated on this.
